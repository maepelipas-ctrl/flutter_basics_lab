# IT 120 Laboratory Answers

**Name:** Mae D. Pelipas  
**Student ID:** 241-00769  
**Section used in project:** IT3A  
**Project:** Flutter Architecture, Widgets and Basic UI

## 1. GitHub repository link
Add your repository URL here after creating and pushing the project to GitHub.

## 2. Last three `build() called` lines from Activity 2
Run Activity 2, tap the plus button several times, and copy the last three actual lines from VS Code's Debug Console here. Example format only:
- `build() called: 4 glasses`
- `build() called: 5 glasses`
- `build() called: 6 glasses`

## 3. Experiment observations

**Activity 2 — changing `_glasses` outside `setState()`**  
When the value is changed outside `setState()`, the number may change in the variable, but Flutter is not told to rebuild the screen. The displayed count and progress bar may not update until another rebuild happens. I put the change back inside `setState()` afterward.

**Activity 3 — removing `Expanded` from a StatBox**  
Without `Expanded`, the box no longer shares the row's available width equally. The row may become uneven or overflow because each box takes the space it needs. `Expanded` makes the boxes share the available width.

**Activity 5 — changing the button corner radius**  
I changed the ElevatedButton corner radius from 8 to 20. The button corners became more rounded, and the theme applies that style to ElevatedButtons in the app.

## 4. Review questions

**1. What is the difference between a StatelessWidget and a StatefulWidget? Give one example of each from this lab.**  
A StatelessWidget does not keep changing data on its own after it is built. The ProfileCard in Activity 1 is an example. A StatefulWidget can update its screen when its state changes. The WaterTrackerPage in Activity 2 is an example.

**2. Why is a StatefulWidget written as two classes? What does each class do?**  
The StatefulWidget class creates the widget and its State object. The State class stores the changing values and builds the screen again when the state changes.

**3. In Activity 2, what happened when you changed `_glasses` outside `setState()`? Why?**  
The screen did not immediately update because Flutter was not notified to rebuild. Changes that should refresh the UI need to happen inside `setState()`.

**4. Looking at the Debug Console in Activity 2, when is `build()` called?**  
It is called when the page is first built and again when `setState()` causes the page to rebuild, such as after adding or removing a glass or resetting the tracker.

**5. Explain the main axis and the cross axis of a Row and of a Column.**  
For a Row, the main axis goes horizontally and the cross axis goes vertically. For a Column, the main axis goes vertically and the cross axis goes horizontally.

**6. In Activity 3, what happened when you removed `Expanded` from a StatBox? What does `Expanded` do?**  
The boxes no longer shared the row width equally and could become uneven or overflow. Expanded lets a child use a share of the remaining available space.

**7. Why do we use `GridView.builder` for the menu instead of a Column with many children?**  
GridView.builder arranges menu items in a grid and builds items as needed while scrolling. A Column places children in one vertical list and is less suitable for a large, scrollable grid.

**8. How do Stack and Positioned create the Best seller badge in Activity 4?**  
Stack places widgets on top of one another. Positioned places the Best seller badge at a specific location, such as the top-left corner of the menu card.

**9. What is the difference between customizing with ThemeData and with a style on one widget? Give one example of each from Activity 5.**  
ThemeData sets shared styles for the app, such as the app color scheme and ElevatedButton style. A style on one widget affects that specific widget, such as setting a Text widget's font size.

**10. When you flip the dark-mode switch in Activity 5, which widget holds the state, and how does the change reach MaterialApp?**  
`_ThemeDemoAppState` stores the `_isDark` value. The switch calls `_setDark`, which updates the value inside `setState()`. MaterialApp rebuilds and uses `themeMode` to select the light or dark theme.

## Before submission
- [ ] Replace the sample Debug Console lines with the actual lines from your run.
- [ ] Add your GitHub repository link.
- [ ] Capture and save all seven required screenshots in `screenshots/`.
- [ ] Confirm your official section and update the project/file name if it is not IT3A.
- [ ] Run all five activities and check for errors.
